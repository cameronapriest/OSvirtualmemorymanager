My submitted files include output.txt, which diffs with
correct.txt. To run my program on your own, first run
"make clean". This removes the previous executable and
the file "output.txt". To compile the program, run "make"
or "make virtual" or "make all". To run the executable,
run "./virtual addresses.txt". Error handling is included
to ensure a file is include as a command line argument.

When the executable is run, the file "output.txt" is created
and written to as specified in the assignment. The entire
program works according to the assignment specification.

In addition, my program prints each virtual address to stdout
along with information about each address. Each address either:

1. Results in a TLB hit.
2. Results in what I called a Page table "hit", which occurs
   as a result of a TLB miss.
3. Results in a page fault.

After running the executable, the command:
"diff output.txt correct.txt" can be run to show no differences
between the correct output and my output.
